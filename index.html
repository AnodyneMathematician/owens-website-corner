        <p>  Hello everyone, Owen here. I am
            an Honours student at the University of Western Australia currently undertaking research in Complex Systems.<br>
            This website is very bare bones at the moment but it should hopefully be more built up soon.

            I have recieved an email telling that we should inform you about the Physics, Mathematics & Computer Science Awards. 
            In case it hasn't been mentioned to you already I would recommend considering sending one for your favourite lecturers and tutors. 
            There are definitely a few lecturers and tutors who I think should get some kind of award for the work they have done -
            most of them are too humble to even consider pursuing an award - but   
            after spending four years seeing being present in Math lectures and tutorials 
            I truly believe vindicating teaching quality is something the Math department needs right now.

        <p>
            A live camera from Odaiba, Tokyo. <br>
            For me there's something wonderful seeing the cars go past,
            thinking about the lives each one of them has, and their subtle effect on how they make the world a happier and 
            better place.
