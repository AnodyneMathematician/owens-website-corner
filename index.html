        <p>  Hello everyone, Owen here. I am currently 
            an Honours student at the University of Western Australia currently undertaking research in Complex Systems.<br>
            This website is very bare bones at the moment but it should hopefully be more built up soon.

        <p>
            A live camera from Odaiba, Tokyo. <br>
            For me there's something wonderful seeing the cars go past,
            thinking about the lives each one of them has, and their subtle effect on how they make the world a happier and 
            better place.
